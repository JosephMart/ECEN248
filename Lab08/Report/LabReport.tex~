\section*{Objective}

\hspace{15pt}In this lab, students were introduced to latches and flip-flops. These sequential logic
circuits will be described in first structual Verilog and then behavioral Verilog.
Synchronous sequential circuits will also be introduced towards the end of the lab.
Delays will also be added to logic gates for the first time while implementing a
clock signal. Finally, students will design one block of code that will include
both flip-flops and combinational logic (full adder) to simulate synchronous logic.

\section*{Design}

% Verilog code template
% \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,,caption=4-Bit ALU ]{../code name.v}

\section*{Results}

Explain the 2 unit delay to 4 units and explain the results of the simulation
(Experiment 1 1.e) \\

(Experiment 1 3.b) Do the latches behave as expected? Why or why not? \\

(Experiment 1 4.b) Compare the waveforms you captured from the behavioral Verilog
to those captured from the structual. Are they different? If so, how?

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Include the source code with comments for all modules you
    simulated. You do not have to include test bench code that was
    provided; however, you must supply the test bench code that you wrote! Code
    without comments will not be accepted.}

    \textit{In the report.}

  \item \textbf{Include screenshots of all waveforms captured during simulatio in addition
    to the test bench console output for each test bench simulation.}

    \textit{In the report.}

  \item \textbf{Answer \underline{all} questions throughout the lab manual.}

    \textit{In the report.}

  \item \textbf{Compare the behavioral description of the synchronous adder found in the
    test bench code with the combination of stuctual and dataflow Verilog you
    used in the lab assignment. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
    Which do you perfer and why?}

  \item \textbf{Based on the clock period you measured for your synchronous adder, what
    would be the theoretical maximum clock rate? What would be the effect of
    increasing the width of the adder on the clock rate? How might you improve the
    clock rate of the design?}
