\section*{Objective}

\hspace{15pt}In this lab, a fast-adder circuit for two-opperand addition was designed called carry-lookahead addition. The design consists of using a combination of dataflow and structural Verilog. The designs were then simulated on the Xilinx ISE to check for correctness. The propagation delays for for a 4-bit and 16-bit carry-lookahead adder were also analyzed in order to compare to similar sized ripple-carry adders.

\textbf{Experiment 1}

To start off the experiment, the following code was written for the most part as part of the prelab. A few modifications were made into order to function properly. The first three blocks of code are of the modules (\textit{generate-propagate-unit, carry-lookahead-unit,} and \textit{summation-unit}) used in \textit{Code Block 4} for the top level   module \textit{carry-lookahead-4bit}

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,,caption=Top Level Carry Lookahead (4-Bit)]{../code/carry_lookahead_4bit.v}
  
  For the next part, gate delays were modified in the following modules.

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=8,firstline=8,lastline=8,caption=Summation Unit (4-Bit with Delay)]{../code/summation_unit_delay.v}

  \hspace{-15pt}\textbf{Experiment 2}
  
  In the next experiment, a block carry lookahead unit was designed. The module interface is as follows:

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,,caption=Block Carry Lookahead Unit]{../code/block_carry_lookahead_unit.v}
  
  Next, the generate propegate unit and summation unit were modified in order to take in 15 bit wires as shown below. The gate delays were also removed.
  
  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=4,firstline=4,lastline=5,caption=Generate Propagate Unit (16-Bit)]{../code/generate_propagate_unit_delay.v}
  
  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=4,firstline=4,lastline=5,caption=Summation Unit (16-Bit)]{../code/summation_unit_delay.v}
  
  Finally the past modules were implemented into a topâˆ’level module for a 16-bit carry lookahead adder.

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Include the source code with comments for all odules in lab. you do not have to include test bench code. Code without comments will not be accepted!}
  \item \textbf{Include the simulation screenshots requested in the above experiments in addition to the corresponding test bench console output.}
  \item \textbf{Answer all questions throught the lab manual}
  \item \textbf{How does the gate-cout of the 16-bit carry-looahead adder compar to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size.}
  \item \textbf{How does the progaagtion delay of the 4-bit carry-lookahead adder compare to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size. Similarly, how does the 16-bit carry-lookahead adder compare to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size.}
