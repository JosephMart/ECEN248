\section*{Objective}

\hspace{15pt}In this lab, a fast-adder circuit for two-opperand addition was designed called carry-lookahead addition. The design consists of using a combination of dataflow and structural Verilog. The designs were then simulated on the Xilinx ISE to check for correctness. The propagation delays for for a 4-bit and 16-bit carry-lookahead adder were also analyzed in order to compare to similar sized ripple-carry adders.

\textbf{Experiment 1}

To start off the experiment, the following code was written for the most part as part of the prelab. A few modifications were made into order to function properly. The first three blocks of code are of the modules (\textit{generate-propagate-unit, carry-lookahead-unit,} and \textit{summation-unit}) used in \textit{Code Block 4} for the top level   module \textit{carry-lookahead-4bit}

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,,caption=Top Level Carry Lookahead (4-Bit)]{../code/carry_lookahead_4bit.v}
  
  For the next part, gate delays were modified in the following modules.

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=8,firstline=8,lastline=8,caption=Summation Unit (4-Bit with Delay)]{../code/summation_unit_delay.v}

  \hspace{-15pt}\textbf{Experiment 2}
  
  In the next experiment, a block carry lookahead unit was designed. The module interface is as follows:

  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,,caption=Block Carry Lookahead Unit]{../code/block_carry_lookahead_unit.v}
  
  Next, the generate propegate unit and summation unit were modified in order to take in 15 bit wires as shown below. The gate delays were also removed.
  
  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=4,firstline=4,lastline=5,caption=Generate Propagate Unit (16-Bit)]{../code/generate_propagate_unit_delay.v}
  
  \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog,firstnumber=4,firstline=4,lastline=5,caption=Summation Unit (16-Bit)]{../code/summation_unit_delay.v}
  
  Finally the past modules were implemented into a topâˆ’level module for a 16-bit carry lookahead adder.

\section*{Conclusion}

  In conclusion, I learned how faster adders than ones previously created are designed. This lab also allowed me to build upon my ability to create basic modules using both structural and dataflow Verilog. After creating a 4-Bit adder, I was able to create a 16-bit lookahead adder using and modifying previously created modules.

\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Include the source code with comments for all modules in lab. you do not have to include test bench code. Code without comments will not be accepted!}
    \textit{In report}
  \item \textbf{Include the simulation screenshots requested in the above experiments in addition to the corresponding test bench console output.}
      \textit{In report}
  \item \textbf{Answer all questions through the lab manual: If your calculations in the prelab are correct and you correctly added delays to your sub-modules,
you should find that the computed delay matches the measure delay. Is this the case?}
  No they do not match. I believe the issue is with how gate delays were not assigned correctly.
  
  \item \textbf{How does the gate-count of the 16-bit carry-looahead adder compare to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size.}
  
  The gate-count of a 16-bit-carry-lookahead adder compared to a ripple-carry of the same size is that CLA has 82-gates and RC has 80 gates. Also the CLA functions faster than the RC.
  
  \item \textbf{How does the propagation delay of the 4-bit carry-lookahead adder compare to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size. Similarly, how does the 16-bit carry-lookahead adder compare to that of a ripple-carry adder of the same size.}
  
  The propagation delay of a 16-bit carry lookahead adder compared to a ripple carry adder is that the 16-bit CLA has a bigger delay than the RC. This is due to how the CLA uses parallel circuitry rather than a long string of full adders in series like the RC.
  
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Student Feedback}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What did you like most about the lab assignment and why? What did you like least about it and why?}
  I liked building upon my knowledge of verilog.

  \item \textbf{Were there any section of the lab manual that were unclear? If so, what was unclear? Do you have any suggestions for improving the clarity?}
  The lab was pretty clear

  \item \textbf{What suggestions do you have to improve the overall lab assignment?}
  This was the easiest lab so far so I do not have any suggestions.
